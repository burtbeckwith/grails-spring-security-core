    To guard against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation" target="blank">session-fixation attacks</a> set the <code>useSessionFixation</code> attribute to <code>true</code>:<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>grails.plugins.springsecurity.useSessionFixation = <span class="java&#45;keyword">true</span></pre></div><p class="paragraph"/>When this is active, on successful authentication a new HTTP session will be created and the previous session's attributes will be copied into it. This way, if you were to start your session by clicking a link that was generated by someone trying to hack your account which contained an active session id, you would no longer be sharing the previous session after login - you'd have your own.<p class="paragraph"/>This is less of an issue now that Grails by default does not include jsessionid in URLs (see <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GRAILS-3364" target="blank">this JIRA issue</a>) but it's still a good idea to use this feature regardless.<p class="paragraph"/>There are a couple of configuration options:<p class="paragraph"/><table class="wiki-table" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><th><strong class="bold">Name</strong></th><th><strong class="bold">Default Value</strong></th><th>&#160;</th></tr><tr class="table-odd"><td>sessionFixation.migrate</td><td><code>true</code></td><td>whether to copy the session attributes of the existing session to the new session after login</td></tr><tr class="table-even"><td>sessionFixation.alwaysCreateSession</td><td><code>false</code></td><td>whether to always create a session even if one didn't exist at the start of the request</td></tr></table><p class="paragraph"/>
