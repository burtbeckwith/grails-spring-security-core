    Another authentication mechanism supported by Spring Security is certificate-based, or "mutual authentication". To use this you must use HTTPS and configure the server to require a client certificate (ordinarily only the server provides a certificate). Your username will be extracted from the client certificate if it's valid, and you'll be considered "pre-authenticated". As long as there is a corresponding user in the database with that username, your authentication will succeed and you won't be asked for a password, and the your <code>Authentication</code> will contain the authorities associated with your username.<p class="paragraph"/>There are a few configuration options available for this feature:<p class="paragraph"/><table class="wiki-table" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><th><strong class="bold">Property</strong></th><th><strong class="bold">Default Value</strong></th><th><strong class="bold">Meaning</strong></th></tr><tr class="table-odd"><td>useX509</td><td><code>false</code></td><td>whether to support certificate-based logins</td></tr><tr class="table-even"><td>x509.continueFilterChainOnUnsuccessfulAuthentication</td><td><code>true</code></td><td>whether to proceed when an authentication attempt fails to allow other authentication mechanisms to process the request</td></tr><tr class="table-odd"><td>x509.subjectDnRegex</td><td>'CN=(.&#42;?),'</td><td>the regex for extracting the username from the certificate's subject name</td></tr><tr class="table-even"><td>x509.checkForPrincipalChanges</td><td><code>false</code></td><td>whether to re-extract the username from the certificate and check that it's still the current user when there's a valid <code>Authentication</code> already</td></tr><tr class="table-odd"><td>x509.invalidateSessionOnPrincipalChange</td><td><code>true</code></td><td>whether to invalidate the session if the principal changed (based on a <code>checkForPrincipalChanges</code> check)</td></tr></table><p class="paragraph"/>The details around configuring your server for SSL and configuring browser certificates are beyond the scope of this document, but if you're using Tomcat you should look at its <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/ssl-howto.html" target="blank">SSL documentation</a>. Also, one quick way to get a test environment working is to use the instructions from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1180397/tomcat-server-client-self-signed-ssl-certificate" target="blank">this discussion at Stack Overflow</a>.
