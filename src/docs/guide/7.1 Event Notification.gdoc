You can set up event notifications in two ways. The sections that follow describe each approach in more detail.

* Register an event listener, ignoring events that do not interest you. Spring allows only partial event subscription; you use generics to register the class of events that interest you, and you are notified of that class and all subclasses.
* Register one or more callback closures in @grails-app/conf/Config.groovy@ that take advantage of the plugin's @org.codehaus.groovy.grails.plugins.springsecurity.SecurityEventListener@. The listener does the filtering for you.
